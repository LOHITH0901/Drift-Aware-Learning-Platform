## 🌟 What is this?
This is an advanced **Adaptive Learning Platform** designed to help students learn effectively and help teachers monitor progress. Unlike standard quizzes, this system **"thinks"** using Artificial Intelligence.

### Key Features:
1.  **🤖 AI-Powered Assessments**: The system uses a local AI (Ollama/Phi-3) to generate unique questions every time. No two quizzes are the same!
2.  **🧠 Concept Drift Detection**: It detects if you are forgetting topics over time (using the "River" algorithm) and adapts the curriculum.
3.  **📊 Smart Analytics**: Tracks student mastery using Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) to recommend the perfect study material.
